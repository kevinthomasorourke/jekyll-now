Hi, I am a software developer. This is my simple blog detailing my shenanigans 
setting up a presence on the internet.

### More Information

It's main purpose is to act as a location of bits of information that I would 
normally remember having done but have no clue how. A kind of free flow reference 
place or brain dump of how I set all this stuff up.

I am currently available for contract work from September.
