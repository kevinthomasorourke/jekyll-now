## Intro
Before getting in to what's what thought I'd put a few thoughts down about my experience in software development. It's just my opinion and I'll throw in more as and when I think of things that I think work or don't. It isn't the de-facto way of doing things. 
    

### C# Software Development

Good software design starts with understanding the user or stakeholder requirements. Meeting with and discussing the project with them to get an idea of what they want and how you can help them to achieve it.

This usually gives you a good idea of the scale of the system and can then help in the Design and Planning and estimating. 

Depending on the project it is essential to meet or gather as many user stories as possible. The more information you have here will mean the client will be happier. 

Document all conversations / agreements with the client and ensure they understand what they are getting. Many times I have heard ... 'Thats not what i asked for', without documentation of agreed functionality you will be refactoring or rewriting key sections.

A good PM (Project Manager) is invaluable. They make everyones life easier by getting the requirements documented correctly, keeping track of deliverables and liase with the client to get key information the developers need to do the job.

I think the Agile way of working works really well in keeping projects flowing and adapting. Allowing the client to see how the system is progressing is really helpful and can stop 

It is essential to the success of the project that everyone meets regularly. Daily scrums can highlight any bottlenecks and allow everyone to help each other.
Client meetings should be held at the end of the sprint only if there is anything cool to show and ideally should contain at least one developer to pass any feeback to the team in a technical way.

We may feel that as developers we always know best and that extra cool functionality is just what the client needs, but really preventing squirreling/scope creep is really important to getting a system finished. Super cool functionality can always be suggested but only implemented if the client understands the cost time implications.

A good test team is another suoer important part of the development process. Developers will always tell you it is not their code or the user shouldn't have done this or pressed that, but ultimately all these errors need handling in an elegant manner.

Delivering change is a key part of the process and to avoid a hellish situation involving versioning, I think it is essentail to have a good source control system, Continual Integration, Build and Deployment system when any code is checked in.

Any code should be really be reviewed and coding standards should be agreed across the team.

Thats about my two penneth worth at the moment.
