## Creating a website
A static website up and running in 20 minutes, on Azure. Costing ,in my case it was Azure.

## Details
Get a domain name from any of the main domain providers.
Sign up to Azure and make use of free credits.
Create your own website and use VSTS or Git as Version Control

In Azure you need to have a basic hosting plan to enable custom domain names.

Find, Clone and then edit a simple bootstrapa template site , or write your own.
Copy your site in to Azure storage.
Need to then point url at it. 

## Create SubDomains
I created a number of subdomains on my domain to host some bits and bobs
