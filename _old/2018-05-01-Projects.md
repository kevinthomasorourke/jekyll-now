## TFS / VSTS
I love having projects on the go, but it essential to know how they are going and when to call them as finished. A big part of that is keeping track, signing tasks off and delivering a finished tested system. TFS is a great way of not only keeping track of tasks, but also works as a version control service and will handle a really comprehensive build and deploy pipeline.
